# AddIt

A simple addition game built with Flutter. Just answer if the addition displayed is right or wrong within 3 seconds.

Addit was initially built as a android and ios App, and then wne the Web technical preview came out, I added Web support to it. Initially it was a difficult process since It was not possible to have a single Code base
for Mobile and Web. But as of March 2020, it's in the dev branch and its easy to add web support.
To get Started with flutter web or add web support to your existing App, [Check here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web)
